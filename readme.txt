A simple plugin to help show your support for your LGBTQI+ friends & colleagues.

== Description ==

[pride.codes](https://pride.codes/) provides a collection of simple widgets for businesses to add to their sites. We want businesses to actively show their support for their LGBTQI+ friends & colleagues.

The Marriage equality campaign is about the values we hold dear. All Australians (or people from any country, for that matter) should be treated equally under the law — and that includes being able to marry the person they love.

Fairness and equality are at the heart of Australian society. We believe our laws should reflect these values of which we are most proud. It’s time for all Australians to be treated equally under the law, with the full rights of equal citizenship.

Marriage is about the commitment shared between two people who love each other and want a secure future together. LGBTI Australians should have the same opportunities for love, commitment and happiness as everyone else.
